# Federated Deep Learning for Image Classification


## FedAvg, FedProx, and ADMM-Based Algorithms with IID and Non-IID Data Distributions


In this project, we will consider the problem of gossip training of distributed deep neural networks for image classification. Gossip learning is a fully-decentralized alternative to federated learning (FL), in which the central controller that is in charge of weight aggregation in FL is removed, and the agents perform a variant of random gossip algorithms to reach consensus and convergence. We apply gossip learning to image classification with convolutional neural networks with different graph models (weight matrices), and compare the results wtih the ones obtained using centralized and federated learning.
